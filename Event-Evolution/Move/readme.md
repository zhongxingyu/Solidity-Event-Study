## Move
Category **move** means that the location of the event use code has been moved but its parameters and name remain the same, and it accounts for a relatively small percentage (5.73\%) of the 419 modifications. The reasons for changes in this category cannot be easily determined. We list the types of
move below and try to give reasons for some of them.

### Move from before an operation to the after of the operation
58.33\% (14 instances) of modifications in this category are moving the event use code from before an operation (such as transaction, assignment, authorization, etc.) to the after of the operation.

### Move from the inside body of conditional statement to outside, or vice versa
29.17\% (7 instances) of modifications in this category are moving the event use code from the inside body of conditional statement or loop statement to outside, or vice versa. We surmise the reason for this type of change is either the condition for triggering event logging has changed or the original triggering condition is wrong.
