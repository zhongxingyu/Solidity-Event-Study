## Addition
Category **Addition** refers to adding an event use in the new version of the code, and it accounts for a significant percentage (34.61\%) of the 419 modifications. The underlying reasons for this category of modifications are as follows.

### Recording Transaction-related Information
35.86\% (52 instances) of modifications in this category are post-transaction additions, which add an event use after the asset transfer code to record transaction-related information.

### Monitoring Variable Value Change Caused by Assignment
17.93\% (26 instances) of modifications in this category are post-assignment additions, where the assignment includes not only the direct variable-to-variable assignment, but also the assignment of results of typical operations (such as function call, math operation, and relational operation) to variables or elements of more complex data structure such as array. Event logging in this case can typically be used to monitor the value change for variables of interest, updating front end of light clents and DApp services accordingly.
