## Deletion
Category **Deletion** refers to the deletion of an event use in the new version of the code, and it accounts for a large percentage (17.66\%) of the 419 modifications.

### Debugging Removal
58.11\% (43 instances) of modifications in this category are related with removing event logging previously used for debugging. The high percentage
of modifications in this category suggests that developers do not delete events that are no longer needed in a timely manner after using event feature for debugging, negatively impacting code readability and increasing gas cost.

### Redundancy Removal
12.16\% (9 instances) of modifications in this category are removing redundant event logging code. Put it in another way, if the recorded content by a certain event use is same as or already included in the recorded contents by some other event uses, then the event use can be deleted to save gas.

### Useless Removal
There are two change instances in this category which arise for removing useless event logging code. If event logging records something that is unnecessary or not used at all, then it should be deleted since EVM logging primitives cost gas. In general, it is hard to determine whether the developer has used useless event logging code from the code only. We need to also consider the commit message if available.
