## Replacement
Category **Replacement** means that the name of the used event is modified without modifying the parameter, and it accounts for a very small percentage (1.19\%) of the 419 modifications. This category of changes arises as the wrong event is used at the beginning or there is an event that is more suitable for recording the needed information. With regard to the reason, it is speculated that developer defines too many events or the locations of the event definitions are scattered, so they forget which events have been defined.
